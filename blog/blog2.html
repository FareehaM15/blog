                    <h2>The End of the World....or is it</h2>
                    <p>The world is ending today.</p>
                    <p>It’s almost empty.</p>
                    <p>They broadcasted 2 years ago that there would be another big bang like the one centuries ago.
                    Since then there have been preparations for moving whatever of the human race they can take to another planet they found that was sustainable for human life.
                    The spaceships have taken almost everyone who could afford it.</p>
                    <p>The ones who couldn’t get on were either the poor or the ones left behind.</p>
                    <p>Like me.</p>
                    <p>Its better me than Lara anyway.</p>
                    <p>Shades of pinks purples and oranges fill the sky marking the end of the day also the end of the world.</p>
                    <p>It’s only a matter of hours now.</p>
                    <p>I settle down on the beach , the place I have the fondest memories of.</p>
                    <p>I reach out for the worn photograph from my pocket.It was taken when we took Lara to the beach for the first time and she was so amazed by the waves and the way the sand squished under her feet and the tiny snails that made their homes in the various shells scattered over the beach. We look so happy in it ,wide smiles on everyone and then there’s Lara looking a little cross eyed trying to look at the tiny snail hidden inside the shell she picked up.</p>
                    <p>I give out a watery laugh remembering it. </p>
                    <p>I slowly drift away to sleep ,the photograph held tightly in my hand.</p>
                    <p> 

                    </p>


                    <p>Its…….morning?</p>
                    <p>Everything looks normal and theres no way i could’ve slept through the entire explosion</p>
                    <p>The world was supposed to end.</p>
                    <p>Maybe they miscalculated the time?</p>
                    <p>Maybe its going to end today.</p>
                    <p>Or is it?</p>
