                    <h2>The Whispering Wonder</h2>
                    
                    <p>Serene couldn’t bear it for a second longer ,she tucked her latest read under her arm opened her window and manuevered her way to her secret solace.</p>
                    <p>It was a beautiful garden that was usually deserted on an equally deserted street. As she made her way to it something from across the street caught her eye. There was a huge building which she’s sure wasn’t there before. As she observed it she felt a tug pulling her towards it. Enchanted she walked towards it. As she drew near she noticed it was pretty much abandoned ,the various windows covered under a thick layer of dust. There was a worn out sign that read ‘The Whispering Wonder’ . 
                    She tried peeking in through one of the windows when she felt a soft rub on one of her legs , she looked down to find a black cat with the greenest eyes she could almost swear they sparkled when she looked into them. She bent down to give it a little rub under its chin. "Awww aren’t you the cutest" she remarked , "Why thank you" it purred back. Wait what. That cat did not just talk to her….right?
                    "On the contrary I think I did". She was dumbfounded while the cat took a round around her as if to examine her. "I wonder what it is about you, but oh well I don’t make the rules, come along then."</p>
                    <p>She couldn’t even begin to comprehend what was happening to her but she was so intruiged to question anything , so she followed the cat to the side of the building where there stood a magnificent door with the most beautiful intricate carvings. "Go on then,open it." The cat urged. Her hand hovered over the knob before she grabbed and twisted it revealing everything she ever dreamed of. There were books as far as the eye could see the bookshelves seemed to go on and on , she also noticed there were people on…….floating ladders? a casket of overflowing books hovering along. She was so busy gawking at everything around her that her brain failed to register the high pitched "COMING THROUGH" before it was too late. Next thing she knew she was on the floor in a pile of books next to an equally disarrayed …..girl? with elf ears?</p>
                    <p>"Sorry about that" , she said as she picked herself up and sheepishly offered a hand , pointing to a ladder beside her with the other "Those can be pretty difficult to control sometimes, oh hey you look new you must be the new keeper recruit, I’m Frey by the way".</p>
                    <p>"Serene" she mumbled back.</p>
                    <p>The cat cleared its throat gaining both of their attention "You, Serene have been chosen as keeper for the books of the world and beyond."</p>
