                    <h2>The Last Sunset</h2>
                    <p>Its been 10 days.</p>
                    <p>10 days since the world turned upside down. 10 days since Ash became truly alone.</p>
                    <p>10 days since all of humanity ceased to exist.</p>
                    <p> was the virus that had been spreading like wildfire all over the world.</p>
                    <p>It spared no one.</p>
                    <p>In the town where Ash lived she and another boy were the only ones that survived. Its been 2 days since she last saw him.
                        Eventually it’s going to come for her too. She wanders aimlessly around the once bustling streets. Sometimes she thinks its all a cruel nightmare, but she knows better. She’s stocked up on resources even though she could breathe her last breath the next second. Stocking up helps her distract herself from the death looming above her head waiting to grab her with its icy hands.</p>
                    <p>She misses Ma and Pa and little Rob. Her eyes water as she recalls memories of her home. Her home that was now gone forever.</p>
                    <p>Its day 11.</p>
                    <p>She hadn’t slept a wink last night. </p>
                    <p>She decides she’s had enough.</p>
                    <p>She visits every familiar nook and corner of her town reminiscing all the moments before making her way to the cliff.</p>
                    <p>By the time she reaches the top, the sky has changed its colours to a mix of pink, orange and yellow, it's beautiful.</p>
                    <p>The sea churns below. The wind blows her hair in her face while she takes one final look at the sunset before she jumps, her back facing the sea.</p>
                    <p>Time slows down.</p>
                    <p>The sky looks even more beautiful, the last of the sun dipping into the horizon.</p>
                    <p>Tears fly into the air as she falls.</p>
                    <p>I'm coming. Coming home.</p>
